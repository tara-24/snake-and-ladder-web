A browser-based **Snake and Ladder game** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project was created as a learning-focused game to understand **programming logic, UI updates, and game flow**.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project was to:
- Learn how real games manage **state** (player position, turns)
- Practice **JavaScript logic and conditions**
- Understand how **UI updates** happen dynamically
- Build confidence by completing a full project from start to finish

## 🕹️ How the Game Works

- Two players take turns rolling a dice 🎲
- Each roll moves the player forward
- 🪜 Ladders move the player up
- 🐍 Snakes move the player down
- The first player to reach **100** wins
- A celebration animation appears when someone wins 🎉
